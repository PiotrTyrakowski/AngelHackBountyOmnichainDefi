# Zeta BestContracts

Zeta BestContracts is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to explore and interact with trustworthy DeFi smart contracts on multiple blockchains such as Solana, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and more. The app, built using the Flutter framework, leverages the power of ZetaChain to provide seamless cross-chain interactions with DeFi smart contracts. Users can review contract descriptions, examine the source code, compile it for verification, and vote on the reliability of these contracts.

## Features

- **Multi-chain Support**: Interact with smart contracts from different blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, Binance, and others via ZetaChain.
- **Smart Contract Verification**: Each contract's code can be compiled and verified to ensure it matches the one deployed on the chain, providing 100% certainty about its authenticity.
- **User Ratings and Reviews**: Users can read detailed contract descriptions and vote on the reliability of smart contracts based on their experience.
- **Code Review**: Access the source code of contracts and review them before interacting.
- **Cross-Chain Interactions**: Use ZetaChain to interact with smart contracts on various blockchains seamlessly.
